Psst. Can you keep a secret? You can? Good! Our boss has gone bad, but I know there is something good in every person. You can help him and maybe he will remembers his lost moral code and we workers can get paid and even leave this place now and then. 
You see the co2 budget in your inventory screen? If you can fetch the items while consuming less co2, our company is seen as good and our boss may feel happiness again. That should remind him what being a good person feels like. Are you in? Yes? Good! I will help you find the items, do not worry about that. Just put the cursor over the item and you get a hint of its whereabouts. Remember to plan your flights so you do not waste your co2. More evil our boss turns, more he fires people, even us trainees. The fired trainees are never heard about again. So be careful. Good luck!
