Hey, I think I should reward my workers more. Our investors are happy that we care about the environment. I feel strange, being an evil overlord doesn’t feel that cool anymore. Maybe I should pay my workers and let them leave. Oh! Is this happiness? So this is what being a good person feels like? Keep up the good work. I’m going to call my mom.
